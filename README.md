# Antitheft-Vehicle-Starter
ML based project providing a antitheft mechanism using Biometric recognition.

## Overview:

The Antitheft Vehicle Starter using Facial Recognition project aims to enhance vehicle security by implementing facial recognition technology. Traditional vehicle security systems often rely on keys, codes, or remote controls, which can be lost, stolen, or duplicated. By integrating facial recognition, this project offers a more secure and convenient way to start a vehicle, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access it.

Several studies have proved the importance of a better security system in the automotive field. Many challenges arise when designing a better security system that is anti-spoofed for an automobile. As technological advancements in the automotive industry have been developed very highly from the early days of automobile production, the key / starting system in the automobile has been the same for many years now. In this research, a new vehicle starter system is proposed that works based on face recognition. The face recognition system has been utilized in this research due to the wide range of applications in security and personal authentication. The FaceNet model a state-of-the-art technique has been implemented in the research for collecting the data of the user this innovative model is combined with a Mobile Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to produce greater results in various illuminations. The whole system is anti-spoofed so any misleading data of the user can be detected easily.

## How It Works:

  - Facial Enrollment: Users enroll their facial biometrics into the system during the setup process.
  - Authentication: When attempting to start the vehicle, the system captures the user's face and compares it against the enrolled biometric data.
  - Access Granting: If the facial recognition matches an authorized user, the system grants access to start the vehicle.
  - Access Denied: If the facial recognition does not match any enrolled user or if there are multiple failed attempts, access to the vehicle is denied.
