# Antitheft-Vehicle-Starter
ML based project providing a antitheft mechanism using Biometric recognition.

Overview:

The Antitheft Vehicle Starter using Facial Recognition project aims to enhance vehicle security by implementing facial recognition technology. Traditional vehicle security systems often rely on keys, codes, or remote controls, which can be lost, stolen, or duplicated. By integrating facial recognition, this project offers a more secure and convenient way to start a vehicle, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access it.
